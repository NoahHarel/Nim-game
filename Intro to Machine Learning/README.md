he course is a basic introduction to machine learning, including:

Supervised learning (PAC learning, VC dimension, perceptron, SVM, stochastic gradient descent, deep learning, boosting, decision trees)
Unsupervised learning (principal component analysls, clustering, EM algorithm)
The course includes both theory and applied machine learning,
and a special emphasis is put on machine learning algorithms.
