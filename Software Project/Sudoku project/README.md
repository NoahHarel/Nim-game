An interactive Sudoku program with an ILP (Integer Programming) solver component, using Gurobi optimization solver.
Uses ILP to both solve Sudoku puzzles and check possible solutions to it.
ILP uses mathematical optimization methods to speed up the solution time, compared to the exponential backtracking algorithm from "Sudoku game".
The program includes user interaction performed through console commands
The program has three main modes: Init, Edit and Solve.
In the Solve mode, the user attempts to solve a pre-existing puzzle.
In the Edit mode, the user edits existing puzzles or creates new ones, and saves these for opening in the Solve mode later.
In the Init mode, the user loads a file to enter either Edit or Solve mode. The program starts in Init mode.
Implemented in collaboration with classmate Itamar Tzafrir
